<!--Changelog

Created: 12-04-2011 / [PK]
Edit #1: 05-05-2011 / [PK] / Added new condition 'more than one group' checked. The 'InvoicesWithCorrectEdition' are exteneded with new group datanodes. Also the filter has been extended to make sure only one of these groups is checked,
and not two or more. But it ignores group datanodeID's that have nothing to do with the invoices. It has become a rather complex filter.
Edit #2: 05-05-2011 / [PK] / Bugfix, annual invoices were not inclueded in the results. This was accidently ommitted.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This file creates the invoices that are to be used in the following reports:
- cxfactuur_controle.html
- cxfactuurTotaalWithExport.html

Use the following variables:
- $correctInvoices (contains all correct invoices)
- $warningInvoices (contains all invoices that have warnings in them, can be invoiced but certain values are 'guessed'.)
- $errorInvoices (contains all invoices that have errors in them, must not be invoiced!)
